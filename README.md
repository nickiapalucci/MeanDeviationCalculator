## Synopsis
This is a command line program that prompts the user to enter a list of numbers and return the mean and standard deviation of those numbers.

## Motivation
To create a useful tool while learning some basic functions of python.  I also wanted to create a simple and intuitive interface that is fault tolerant.

## Installation
This program works best with Python 3.4
